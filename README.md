# Portfolio of projects taken from Saint Joseph's University classes 2022-2026.

## My name is Adam Syed, I am a senior at Saint Joseph's University majoring in Business Intelligence and Analytics with a minor in Computer Science. 

In documents you will find a collection of some notable projects I have completed that exemplify my proficiency in Python, SQL, and R. There are a mix of both solo and team projects, in which I have used Git to collaborate with teammates. 

#Computer Science:

##In this file you will find two folders, both utilizing AI algorithms (A* and Dijkstra). 
##-A* Algorithm: you will find code implementing the A* algoirthm as well as Dijkstra. These examples showcase the features of both path finding searches.
##-Path Finding Robot: this project contains a files to run a path finding algorithm to navigate through a 30x30 grid of a hospital (utilizes A* and Dijkstra).
