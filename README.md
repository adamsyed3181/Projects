# Portfolio of projects taken from Saint Joseph's University classes 2022-2026.

## My name is Adam Syed, I am a senior at Saint Joseph's University majoring in Business Intelligence and Analytics with a minor in Computer Science. 

In documents you will find a collection of some notable projects I have completed that exemplify my proficiency in Python, SQL, and R. There are a mix of both solo and team projects, in which I have used Git to collaborate with teammates. 


## Computer Science:

### In this file you will find two folders, both utilizing AI algorithms (A* and Dijkstra). 
### -A* Algorithm: you will find code implementing the A* algoirthm as well as Dijkstra. These examples showcase the features of both path finding searches.
### -Path Finding Robot: this project contains a files to run a path finding algorithm to navigate through a 30x30 grid of a hospital (utilizes A* and Dijkstra).


## Database Management:

### This file contains a downloadable Microsoft Access file that implements a 3NF relational database written with SQL. The program creates a database containg a university's students, teachers, and various other attributes related to categorizing their submissions.

## R Statistical Programming Language:

### This file contains two folders, utlizing different packages within the R programming language.
### -Midterm: This project contains an R file as well as a presentation on the Plotly packge in R. The code showcases unique featues of the package.
### -R Shiny: This file contains an R file that uses the Shiny package to create an interactive data visualization web application.
